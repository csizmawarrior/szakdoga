# Measuring BERT models with probing

The programs have one goal, implementing a neural network that will probe the output of the BERT model in question and return the accuracy achieved on it or the predicted types for a given data group.

It is mainly based on transformers library by huggingface and uses Python3 in the implementation. There are basic script files that help iterating through the now existing datas on any BERT model and extract the results into well distributed files.

The paper about the model is in the repository in hungarian. Named: `szakdolgozat.pdf`

## Quickstart

Requirements: hydra, Python 3, transformers
